## 1. Introduction


![Match LLM](https://github.com/ArpanUchicago/Bayesian-ML-Football-Oracle/blob/d9cd93fbc863690588acdaec87016a43dc69c23b/ChatGPT.png?raw=true)

Traditional sports commentary is either manually delivered by professionals or generated through rigid rule-based systems. These approaches often lack flexibility, contextual nuance, and real-time adaptability. In contrast, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled more dynamic generation of coherent, engaging narratives based on structured data inputs.

This project explores the application of open-source LLMs to generate **live-style, play-by-play soccer commentary** using structured match event data (passes, shots, tackles, etc.). We investigate the capabilities of LLMs like **Mistral-7B**, **GPT-J**, **Phi-4** and **LLaMA 2**, combined with retrieval-based summarization and fine-tuning techniques, to mimic the tone and pacing of real-time human commentators.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Motivation

‚Äî Traditional commentary is manual or rigidly rule-based, lacking real-time nuance.  
‚Äî Open-source LLMs offer dynamic, context-aware narrative generation.

### 2.2 Key Goals

- **Low-cost fine-tuning** (LoRA/QLoRA) for broadcast-quality commentary on commodity hardware  
- **Plug-and-play framework** for clubs/fan apps to deploy AI narrators

### 2.3 Core Features

1. **Event Parsing**  
   Ingests JSON feeds and normalizes timestamps.  
2. **Prompt Templates**  
   Injects match context (score, players, phase) for coherent output.  
3. **Parameter-Efficient Tuning**  
   Applies LoRA for fine-tuning.  
4. **Live Simulation**  
   Streams line-by-line commentary to mimic a real broadcast.

### 2.4 Approach Overview

- **Input:** Structured event data (time, player, action, outcome) from the StatsBomb Open Data repository
  
- **Processing:** Chunk events into short windows, enrich with team/player context
- 
- **Modeling:**
- 
  - **Prompt engineering** with in-context examples  
  - **LoRA fine-tuning** of pre-trained LLMs (Mistral-7B, GPT-J, Phi-4, LLaMA 2)
  -  
- **Output:** Natural language, play-by-play commentary in broadcast style

## 3. Dataset

### 3.1 Source

Statsbomb Open Data (https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data)

* Covers 11 countries
* Seasons: 2008‚Äì2016
* Includes match results, player stats, and play-by-play events
* Key tables used: `match`, `player_attributes`, `event_stream` (custom parsed)

### 3.2 Processed Data Format

* Source: Extracted directly from the match event JSON file provided by StatsBomb.

**Each record contains**:

* **Minute**: When the event occurred

* **Event Type**: Action taken (e.g., pass, shot)

* **Player & Team**: Who performed the action

* **Details**: Contextual metadata parsed from sub-objects (pass, shot, foul_committed, etc.)

This format feeds into the LLM prompt generator and enables highly contextual, realistic commentary output.

| Minute | Event Type | Player         | Team          | Details                                                                         |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5      | Pass       | Joshua Kimmich | Bayern Munich | Picked out Thomas M√ºller‚Äôs run with a lofted ball behind defense.               |
| 17     | Shot       | Kai Havertz    | Chelsea       | Unleashed a curling effort from 20 yards that rifled just past the near post.   |
| 46     | Tackle     | N‚ÄôGolo Kant√©   | Chelsea       | Made a vital sliding interception to halt Bayern‚Äôs early second-half surge.     |
| 78     | Cross      | Leroy San√©     | Bayern Munich | Whipped in an inviting cross from the right flank, met by Lewandowski‚Äôs header. |

## 4. Model Architecture

### 4.1 Commentary Generation Pipeline

1. **Input Feature Extraction:** Time-ordered events per match (passes, goals, fouls, substitutions)
2. **Context Construction:** Include player stats, match importance, recent plays, and team form
3. **Prompt Formulation / Finetuned Input:** Format prompts like:
   *"45‚Äô ‚Äî Player X passes the ball to Player Y near the penalty box..."*
4. **LLM Output:**
   *‚ÄúA slick one-two between Player X and Y slices through the defense‚Äîthis is high-quality football!‚Äù*

**Weighing Event Importance**
* Events are weighted based on their significance to match flow and commentary value:

![Event weights](https://github.com/ArpanUchicago/Bayesian-ML-Football-Oracle/blob/main/Event%20weights.png)

**Dynamic Context Adjustments**
* Our commentary adapts based on match time and situational context:

![Time & context based modifiers](https://github.com/ArpanUchicago/Bayesian-ML-Football-Oracle/blob/main/Time%20%26%20context%20based%20modifiers.png)

**Goal Classification System**
* Goals are further categorized by position and type to generate more specific and accurate commentary:

### 4.2 Models Explored

* **Mistral-7B (base and LoRA-tuned)**
* **GPT-J (6B)**
* **Phi-4**
* **LLaMA 2 (7B, 13B)**

All models were tested with prompt engineering and LoRA fine-tuning for domain adaptation.

## 5. Evaluation

The generated commentary was evaluated using both qualitative and manual human judgment techniques.

## Commentary Comparison: Base Phi-4 vs. LoRA-Tuned Phi-4

We evaluated two versions of our live commentary model:  
1. **Base Phi-4** (vanilla)  
2. **LoRA-Tuned Phi-4**

Below is a summary of the key differences:

| Aspect                      | Base Phi-4                                                                                       | LoRA-Tuned Phi-4                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tone & Emphasis**         | Rich narrative prose with few one-word exclamations.                                             | Frequent uppercase, single-word interjections (e.g., **‚ÄúBRILLIANT!‚Äù**, **‚ÄúINCREDIBLE!‚Äù**) for high impact. |
| **Sentence Structure**      | Highly variable syntax‚Äîsometimes long multi-sentence segments, sometimes short.                  | Consistent rapid-fire template per event:  
``[Minute] <Action> by <Player>! <INTERJECTION>! <Descriptor>``                                    |
| **Conciseness & Pacing**    | ~24 words per segment on average; multiple overlapping lines per event can slow the flow.       | ~15 words per segment; each event described once, yielding snappier live pacing.             |
| **Redundancy**              | Repeats similar descriptions of the same play multiple times.                                    | Bundles each event into a single line, eliminating near-duplicates.                         |
| **Stylistic Flair**         | Flowery metaphors (‚Äúthunders a thunderbolt,‚Äù ‚Äúbone-crunching challenge‚Äù).                         | Controlled dramatic flourishes reserved for standout moments (‚ÄúPOST!,‚Äù ‚ÄúTEXTBOOK!‚Äù).        |
| **Overall Flow**            | Feels like an eager writer looping back on the same action.                                       | Feels like a professional play-by-play feed‚Äîsteady beat, clear signposts, and high energy.   |

### Takeaways & Recommendations

- **Sharper Delivery**: LoRA fine-tuning streamlines verbosity and standardizes structure for a true live-broadcast feel.  
- **Energy & Excitement**: Strategic use of uppercase interjections heightens viewer engagement.  
- **Maintainability**: The template-driven format is easier to tweak (e.g., adjusting interjection lists or segment length).  

> **Next Steps**  
> - Conduct a listener study to rate perceived excitement and clarity.  
> - Experiment with adaptive pacing: shorter segments for routine plays, longer for goals.  
> - Integrate BLEU/ROUGE evaluation against human commentaries for quantitative benchmarking.

## 8. Limitations & Challenges

Hallucinations: Can invent or misattribute events.

Latency: Large models may exceed a 2 s response window.

Data Granularity: Event feeds lack detailed context (e.g., trajectory, off-ball movement).

Style Variability: Commentary tone differs by league and audience.

Evaluation Gaps: Automated metrics don‚Äôt fully capture ‚Äúbroadcast feel.‚Äù

## 9. Conclusions & Future Work

* Fine-tuned open LLMs can effectively simulate broadcast-style soccer commentary
* Prompt engineering is competitive with fine-tuning in smaller setups
* Human-AI hybrid workflows (AI draft + human edit) show promise

**Next Steps:**

* Integrate **speaker-style transfer** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** (e.g. mimic Peter Drury)
* Use multi-modal input (text + images/heatmaps)
* Evaluate in live setting with simulated match feeds
* Deploy in a web app dashboard with real-time updates
