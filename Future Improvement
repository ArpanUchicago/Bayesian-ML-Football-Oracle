🔮 Future Improvements
While the current system generates vivid, accurate match commentary, several improvements are planned:

🧠 1. Fine-Tuning on Sports Language
Train or adapt the model on real-world football commentary transcripts (e.g., FIFA match reports, BBC live text) to improve tone and pacing.

🗣️ 2. Text-to-Speech Integration
Convert generated commentary into spoken audio using models like pyttsx3, gTTS, or Bark for a full broadcast simulation.

🎬 3. Match Timeline Playback
Build a visual timeline interface showing commentary alongside minute-by-minute event playback.

🧩 4. Multilingual Commentary
Extend support for Spanish, French, or Arabic commentary generation based on the same match data.

🎛️ 5. Interactive Prompt Tuning UI
Let users tweak commentary tone, formality, or emotion through a Streamlit interface before generating.

🧪 6. Automated Evaluation
Introduce BLEU, METEOR, or GPT-4 judgment-based scoring to measure fluency, factuality, and excitement.

📊 7. Real-Time API Mode
Turn the pipeline into a microservice that can receive live event streams and produce commentary in real time.
